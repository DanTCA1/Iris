# Iris: FRC Bling helper

This tool (while still in very much a beta state) will in the future be able to compile bling shows down to .bling files (Just like FBling, a [different project](https://github.com/FinnSpartronics/fbling-sim) that required python to work)

Current state:
- [x] Test out Iris zip file config storage
- [ ] Test out RGB, HSL, and HSLuv color types
- [ ] Add some sort of actual UI
- [ ] Test out some sort of robot preview
- [ ] Test out an editor for 2d rgb plates as well
